/* btkbd.h -- a Bluetooth keyboard for the PicoCalc (Pico 2 W)

 *
 * Keys typed on a Bluetooth keyboard come out of btkbd_read() in the same
 * form as the PicoCalc's own keyboard gives them from sb_read_keyboard():
 * (state << 8) | code, with KEY_STATE_PRESSED or KEY_STATE_RELEASED and the
 * codes in the text starter's keyboard.h. Ctrl, Shift and Alt come as
 * their own presses and releases (KEY_MOD_CTRL and so on), letters in
 * lower case, other characters already shifted -- just as the PicoCalc
 * sends them -- so a program can mix the two keyboards in one loop.
 *
 * Linked with bluetooth.cmake, the keys also come out of sb_read_keyboard(),
 * after the PicoCalc's own, so a program that reads the keyboard through
 * the text starter's driver gets the Bluetooth keyboard with no changes;
 * btkbd_merge(false) turns that off (to tell the two keyboards apart).
 *
 * A Bluetooth mouse can be paired too, alongside the keyboard: btkbd_mouse()
 * gives its movement. (A keyboard's own trackpad comes out of it as well.)
 *
 * Both kinds of keyboard work: "classic" Bluetooth ones, and Bluetooth Low
 * Energy (BLE) ones, which speak HID over GATT.
 *
 * Bluetooth runs in the background. Pairing is done with the btpair
 * program; other programs only reconnect, and needn't call btkbd_poll().
 *
 * The pairings are kept on the SD card, in /bluetooth/pairing.dat, so every
 * program that uses this finds the same keyboard and mouse.
 *
 *     btkbd_init();                  // after fs_init() (or picocalc_init())
 *     ...then read the keyboard as usual
